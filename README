Conway's Game of Life
=====================
Surprisingly, only after all this time, this is my very first implementation
of Conway's Game of Life. The simulation area is 80x20 characters. The software
uses the ncurses library.

The initial state of the simulation is stored in a file named 'state.txt', where
the 'X' character means a living cell, and a whitespace means a dead cell. All
other characters are omitted.
